# 🏃‍♂️ Death Dash
A high-speed, third-person endless runner built in Unity — designed to showcase advanced C# scripting, custom physics, and gameplay systems. This project demonstrates real-time game logic, asset integration, and performance optimization for indie-style game development.

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

In **Death Dash**, the player sprints through a dystopian world dodging obstacles, leaping across deadly gaps, and collecting power-ups — all while the game's speed dynamically scales with time to increase difficulty. Built to replicate the addictiveness and polish of mobile/arcade runners, this project emphasizes responsive controls, procedural level design, and a tight gameplay loop.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔁 **Endless level system** with procedural chunk loading and auto-recycling
- 🧠 **Finite state machine (FSM)** for player animation and movement
- 🧱 **Obstacle spawning engine** with randomized logic and difficulty scaling
- 🎯 **Collision & damage system** with visual/audio feedback
- 🎵 **Sound manager** with event-driven SFX and background music control
- 🏆 **Score tracking** and high-score persistence (PlayerPrefs)
- 🎮 Optimized for **desktop and WebGL builds**
